Here is a sample document which was typeset using the IntuiType Markdown Typesetter.
Everything is written in 12-point Times Roman.
Each paragraph is justified, and the first line of each paragraph is indented.

Here is a second paragraph.
In the markdown source, line breaks can be placed wherever, but an empty line indicates the end of a paragraph and the beginning of the next.
Since parentheses have meaning in PostScript, the program should escape any parentheses in the source (assuming this was implemented correctly).
