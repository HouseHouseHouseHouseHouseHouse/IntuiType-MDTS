Here is a sample document which was typeset using the IntuiType Markdown Typesetter.
The first line of this paragraph should be indented, meaning there is space between the left margin and the type,
which in this case should be one inch of space.
This paragraph should be justified, meaning the left side of the paragraph is flush with the left margin, and the right side is flush with the right margin,
except the final line, unless it just happens to be the right length.
There should also be leading, or space between each line, and in this case it should be fifteen percent of the font height.

Here is another paragraph.
There should be one line's worth of space between this and the previous paragraph.
Paragraph spacing is used in addition to indentation to emphasize the change in subject matter between paragraphs.

> This is a block-quote.
> The paragraph should be justified, and every line should be indented from both the left and the right, making the paragraph appear horizontally condensed.
> Block-quotes are generally used when a quote or excerpt is four lines or more.
