# Example Document

---

Here is a sample document which was typeset using the `IntuiType Markdown Typesetter.`
This paragraph should be **justified,** meaning the left side of the paragraph is flush with the left margin, and the right side is flush with the right margin,
except the final line, unless it just happens to be the right length.
There should also be **leading,** or space between each line, and in this case it should be *fifteen percent* of the font height.

Here is another paragraph.
The first line of this paragraph should be **indented,** meaning there is space between the left margin and the type,
which in this case should be *half an inch* of space.
There should also be one line's worth of space between this and the previous paragraph.
Paragraph spacing is used in addition to indentation to emphasize the change in subject matter between paragraphs.

## Additional Formatting

### Block-Quotes
> This is a block-quote.
> The paragraph should be justified, and every line should be indented from both the left and the right, making the paragraph appear horizontally condensed.
> Block-quotes are generally used when a quote or excerpt is four lines or more.

### Lists

#### Numbered Lists
1. This is the first item in a numbered list.
It should be preceded by the number one, and every line should be indented.
2. This is the second item in a numbered list.
Lists like these are generally used in memoranda for brevity and ease in reading.
3. This is the third item in a numbered list.
Three is generally the minimum number of items in a list,
as having fewer items will make the writing simple enough to be understood without the context of one.

#### Bullet Lists
- This is an item in a bullet list.
Bullet lists differ from numbered lists in that items have no particular order.
- This is another item in a bullet list.
As with ordered lists, every line should be indented.
  - This is an item in a lower-order list.
  - Lower-order items should be indented further than higher-order items.
- This is another item in a bullet list.
Since items have no particular order, numbers aren't needed, and so dots or "bullets" are used in their place.

### Columns
The entirety of this document should be written in two columns, with the exception of the first heading.
At some point, text should overflow into from the left-hand column into the right-hand column.
Separating the two columns should be a **gutter,** which is a bit of horizontal spacing,
and in this case it should be *half an inch* wide.

### Code Blocks
```
// This is a code block.
#include <stdio.h>

// Indentation is rendered and
// no formatting is done.
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```
