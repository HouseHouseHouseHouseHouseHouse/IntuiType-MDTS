Here is a sample document generated by my Ruby program.
Everything should be written in 12-point Times Roman.
Each paragraph should be justified, and the first line of each paragraph should be indented.

Here is a second paragraph.
In the plaintext source, line breaks can be placed wherever, but an empty line indicates the end of a paragraph and the beginning of the next.
Since parentheses have meaning in PostScript, the program should escape any parentheses in the source (assuming this was implemented correctly).
Goodness me!
